# TQSG
Tricky's Quick SDL Graphics (and by now more than just that)


These were just some routines to make things quicker, and also easier to tie up to my Apollo engine. I kept them separate in order to use these for other projects as well if I need to.

When it comes to compiling. Of course you need SDL2 and SDL2_Image, other than that these files were just set up to quickly dump them into Visual Studio, so the project builder will turn them into OBJ files and link them properly accordingly.

TQSG was also designed to communicate with the JCR6 file system. So that system must also be present when you compile.

All zlib licensed if you have a need for these.
